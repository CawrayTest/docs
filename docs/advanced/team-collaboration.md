## Permissions & groups
ConfigCat has the following permissions:
* *Manage Members* - allows you to invite and remove team members, manage permissions, and see the product-level audit log
* *Manage Resources* - allows you to create, update and delete feature flags, settings, configs, and environments
* *Full access* to all/some environment - allows you to change setting values and switch feature flags
* *Read-only access* to all/some environment - allows you to see feature flags and settings, but prevents you from changing their value
* *No access* to a specific environment - prevents you from seeing and changing setting values

*Permission groups* are collections of permissions. They help you organize the permissions into groups that are meaningful to you.

> For example, you could define the following *Permission groups*:
> * Administrator - *Manage Members*, *Manage Resources*, *Full access* to all environments
> * Product Manager -  *Full access* to all environments
> * Developer - *Manage Resources*, *Read-only access* to LIVE environment, *Full access* to all other environments

You control what your *Team members* are allowed to do by assigning them to these *Permission groups*.
